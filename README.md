diesel = di - es - el = DSL = helper library for creating your own DSL

Really, it's just a small set of functions, macros, and conventions to provide syntactic sugar for creating deeply nested data values.  To my mind, the resulting forms are a bit more readable than the raw data structure they create.

What you end up with may not be a true DSL according to purists.  But I think you'll find it useful.  I have.

By sharing, I hope to gain valuable feedback to accelerate my path to harnessing the true power of Clojure.  I'm hooked.

Stay tuned...
